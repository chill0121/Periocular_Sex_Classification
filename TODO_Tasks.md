- [] Feature Extractions
- [] Activation Maps from Weights
- [X] Shallow FFN
- [] Shallow CNN
  - [] Create Basic Version
  - [] Optimize Stride
  - [] Optimize Layers
  - [] Choose Padding Solution
  - [] Evaluate a Flattened Version
- [] PCA on Feature Embeddings or Semantic Clustering from Feature Vector on CNN
- [] Occlusion Sensitivity Plots (Class Decision Regions)
