# Periocular Sex Classification

This project focuses on using an image dataset of eyes, which includes not only the iris but also the surrounding periocular region, to build Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) classifiers for identifying the sex of the individual in the image. A key aspect of the project is analyzing the image features extracted by the models to identify those most relevant for sex classification. Additionally, multiple DCNN architectures will be explored, with models trained on two versions of the dataset: one with the original images and another with randomly augmented images. The training and performance of these models will be compared to evaluate the impact of data augmentation.

Identifying the sex of an individual from periocular images has important applications in various fields, from security and biometric authentication to medical diagnostics. In security, such models can enhance identity verification systems in situations where only partial or low-resolution facial data is available. Moreover, automated sex classification using periocular regions could improve the accuracy of systems used in demographics analysis and research. By building classifiers that focus on this subtle but ubiquitous piece of an individual's biometrics, this project addresses the need for more adaptable, hopefully privacy-conscious, and efficient systems in multiple real-world scenarios with limited or non-ideal data.
